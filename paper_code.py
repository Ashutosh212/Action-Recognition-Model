Placeholders currently:

Coarse Segmentation in coarse_segmentation:
    coarse_labels = np.random.randint(0, 5, size=num_frames)
Replace this with an inference call to your pretrained action recognition model (e.g., using mmaction2).

Periodicity Detection in repnet_periodicity_detection:    
    boundaries = list(range(0, num_frames, 30))
    if boundaries[-1] != num_frames - 1:
        boundaries.append(num_frames - 1)
Substitute this dummy periodicity (fixed interval every 30 frames) with your RepNet-based periodicity detection (using your RepNet implementation)

Motion Feature Computation in compute_motion_features:
    joint_angles = np.zeros((num_frames, num_keypoints))
    angular_velocities = np.zeros((num_frames-1, num_keypoints))
Replace these with proper computations based on your skeleton topology and joint dynamics.

Visual Feature Extraction in extract_visual_features:
    # For demonstration, simply average the pixel intensities as a dummy feature.
    feat = np.mean(resized, axis=(0, 1))
Replace with a call to your action recognition backbone (e.g., a pretrained mmaction2 model) to extract meaningful visual features.

Optional – Feature Fusion in fuse_features - concat of visual and flattened pose features:
    fused = np.concatenate([v_feat, flat_pose])
If you decide to incorporate RepNet embeddings (best_embeddings), you’ll need to update this fusion method.
